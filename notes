Build an online platform that allows any user to upload products to sell, modify listing information, and track inventory count as items get purchased. The platform allows users to add products to cart (if they are in stock), check out the product, enter shipping information, and view order history. You must also implement a chat feature that allows buyers and sellers to chat with each other in real time. You are free to decide what kinds of product users may buy/sell â€“ it could be very general like Ebay or focused on a specific type of product. If you choose a specific type of product, feel free to add features that cater your marketplace to that kind of product (i.e. a marketplace specifically for computers might allow seller to enter attributes such as CPU, memory size, and brand into the listing)
