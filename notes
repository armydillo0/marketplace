Build an online platform that allows any user to upload products to sell, 
modify listing information, and track inventory count as items get purchased. 
The platform allows users to add products to cart (if they are in stock), 
check out the product, enter shipping information, and view order history. 
You must also implement a chat feature that allows buyers and sellers to chat 
with each other in real time. You are free to decide what kinds of product 
users may buy/sell – it could be very general like Ebay or focused on a specific 
type of product. If you choose a specific type of product, feel free to add 
features that cater your marketplace to that kind of product (i.e. a marketplace 
specifically for computers might allow seller to enter attributes such as CPU, 
memory size, and brand into the listing)

1. Control panel that allows users to list products to sell. 
A listed product should include at least a photo, a name, a description,
a price and an inventory count. Users should be able to add, update and 
delete product listings.

2. Allow users to browse products, add products to cart, view total price 
of the cart, input shipping address, and finish check out. Upon check out,
product inventory count must be updated, and users must not be allowed to 
purchase items that are out of stock.

3. Users should be able to see their order history, which includes the 
products that have been purchased.

4. Use WebSocket to allow buyers to chat with sellers in real time. It’s up
to you how you want to implement this. One approach is to have a chat room
for each seller, which anyone can join.
